# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of the analysis was to provide ride-sharing data by city type. City types include Urban, Suburban, and Rural. The analysis extracted information from the data related to rides, drivers, and fares in each city type. 

## Results
The analysis found differences in rides, drivers, and fares for each city type. The urban environment, as you would expect, was found to have the highest amount of drivers and riders, which resulted in the highest total fares among the three groups. The rural environment was found to have the lowest amount of drivers and riders which resulted in the lowest total fares among the three groups. However, the rural areas had the highest average fare per ride and the highest average fare per driver.<br>

## Summary
Based on the results of the analysis:
- Drivers operating within an urban setting will compete with more drivers but will have more opportunities for rides. Driving in an urban environment is optimal for drivers who drive more frequently.
- Drivers operating within a suburban setting compete with less drivers but have less ride opportunities than those of an urban setting. 
- Drivers operating within a rural setting compete with less drivers than urban and suburban settings and have less ride opportunities than both settings but have higher average fares per ride and the highest average fare per driver. Driving in a rural environment is optimal for drivers who don't drive as frequently and are seeking less total rides.
